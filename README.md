# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Michael

I am a Customer Success Manager at UiPath with a position of Public Trust. I help customers succeed and grow by building specialized solutions for their automation programs, and ensuring business goals are overachieved.

I am experienced in software engineering, product support, technical consulting, professional services and customer success. I have worked closely with organizations across multiple industries, including BFSI, Commercial, Hardware, Retail, and SaaS. Most recently, my focus has been in Public Sector, previously working closely with Federal/Civilian agencies, and now focusing on SLED organizations.
